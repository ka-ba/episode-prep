This episode will be about the Quantum Tron: https://www.quantum-systems.com/products/quantum-tron/

------------------------------

* Introduction
  - Florian
  - Background 
  - Ausgründung Uni

* General
  - size, weight, span, payload
  - endurance, range, speeds
  - how much payload is the sweet spot between a/c size and sensor capabilities?
    - what drove the size
    - "Seibel emphasises that complexity, cost and risk rise in a 
       non-linear manner with weight"
      - component complexity and availability
      - heat development and dissipation?
  - Quick assembly
  - Structure: carbon?

* Uses
  - Monitoring of "long" things: pipelines, railtracks
  - Grid'ing, cartography, crop monitoring
  - Other examples? Military?
    how is operation from ships different? -> landing spot might move :-)
  - Talk about typical payloads.
  - Data Link?

* Why VTOL? 
  - Isn't a cat launch plus net landing easier?
  - Complexities added by the VTOL
  - But: simpler wing design - only for high speed
  - Where did you get the wing cross section? 
    - self developed? why? how? where? Werner Würz :-) 
    - lift:drag of 20 - not so good for a glider pilot :-)
    - elliptical wings, as one should.
  - can you land in airplane cfg?


* Propulsion
  - electrical 
  - Zrafeoffs vs. combustion
  - Isn't there waaaay too much power for cruise flight?
    Also the props must be optimized for hover ....
  - Switching off two of them for cruise. Good compromise?
  - Sawtooth for using them at their ideal speed. Gliders :-)
      -> how does this fit with missions?
  - Use the rear motors for slowing down. Cool!  
  - Custom developed: 
    - motors
    - controllers
    - propellers
    - power distribution.
    why do so much inhouse?
  - Which batteries? How heavy are the battery packs ? Would it be possible to recharge the batteries on board using solar ?
 
* Sensors in the a/c vs. sensors in the payloads.
  - how much in a/c?    
  - interaction between sensors and a/c: 
    steer around in circle to focus on a place
    (more efficient than hover, I guess)  

* Development
  - How did you get the idea?
  - Which "market studies" led to this configuration?
  - Hardware/Sw in the loop 
  - "enabling it to fly hundreds of simulated Trons at the same time"
  - how many did you crash during development?
    - and why? hardware, ESC turned off, human error?
    - telemetry and data recording. What telemetry system is used under this long range ?
    - This is more serious than model airplanes...
    - human error? -> checklists


* Control
  - What is the challenge for the transition? Do you switch between feedback and 
  feedforward controllers? If using feedforward only during the transitions, are 
  there any limits on the disturbances (wind, rain, etc)?
  - diff motor speed vs. nacelle position
    which controls do you use for hovering, controlling a/c there?
    what are the wind limits?
  - Which sensors are used as part of the autopilot? What is the "brain" of the Quantum Tron?
  What micro controller? What kind of development: model-based (especially for the controllers)
  or hand-written code, AI? Is it considered safety-critical, standards covered? 
  - What aero surfaces?
  - Talk us throught the tilting. Challenges?

* Redundancy 
  - where?
  - what happens if a motor stops during hover?
  - which compromises to make things feasible? IMU voting.

* Flying
  - Skills for flying
    One button control -> why? target audience.
  - Remote control vs. autonomous
  - BVLOS -> what is required, legally? 
  - Can it fly during nights?
  - Sensors for autonomous
    - flying predefined routes with expected free airspace
    - vs. "participarting" in the airspace.
  - Compare to copters?
  - Mission planning and control software
  - Autopilot: IMUs, GNSS -> how accurate?    
    
* In terms of components and process, how much does this have in common
  with RC model planes?

* Legals/Context
  - where can you use UAVs?
  - which certification must the aircraft obtain ? (EASA, other)
  - airports, max alt?
  - autonomous flying - what preconditions?
  - what are your thoughts (as a glider pilot) of the integration of UAVs/Drones and real airplanes?
    - air spaces
    - alt limitations
    - licensing

* Who is the dog in the videos?
