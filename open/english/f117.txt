The thing is really like to know is what it was like just to hand fly. What was it like to just fly around; heavy, nimble, responsive, what was it like when you opened the throttle and climbed? I guess; was it fun to fly?
Taking from the comments in the F15 episode, were any missions (even training, non combat) ever flown a lot "by hand" or was it always primarily about careful planning of the route to minimise exposure in the first place and pilot's role was more about following the plan?
 It would be interesting to know how they balanced minimising the radar cross section of the aircraft with the level of fly by wire tech required to make it actually fly. Is it basically the best stealth facet design and then make it work in the air or work backwards from the extreme to get a balance? 
I would also like to hear about the process they went through making sure the solution would perform as expected before letting a human loose on it. CFD, wind tunnel, simulation etc.
 •Being a single seater with such an unusual design, how did the pilots prepare to fly it? If they had simulators, how did they know that they could match the flight characteristics with the unproven design of the real plane?
•Where do you actually start when testing such a new concept/design for the first time? Nearly every other plane previously had been a derivative of the proven concept of a rounded fuselage with teardrop profile wings, but the F-117 with its faceted body/wings must have been a real challenge.



---------- HAL ------------------------

* Introduction Hal Farley

* a bit about your career
  - Lockheed test pilot, not AF
  - buf AF history?
  - did you go through the TPS?
  - Grumman before. F-14
  

--------- The airplane ---------------

* Developed by Skunk Works!
  - a bit about the Skunk Works
  - under Ben Rich, not Kelly Johnson

* Describe the aircraft (I assume everyone has seen it)
  - very very delta
  - V tail
  - two engines (F404, like F-18)
  - faceted
  - Size ca. like an F-15

* how did you react when you saw it first :-) ?

* what was the cockpit like? 
  - Steam Gauges or screens?
  - I think I have seen both?


* Brief history of stealth
  - Russia: Pyotr Ufimtsev
  - wasn't invented by Skunk Works, was it? 
  - But: Denys Overholser
  - https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBB_Lampyridae
  - trick 1: deflect away
    . no 90 degrees ("cats eyes")
    . leading edge > 50 deg
  - trick 2: absorb
  - works for monostatic radars; 
    Passive (multistatic) radar, bistatic radar and especially multistatic 
    radar systems can detect stealth aircraft

* Which components were taken from other airplanes?
  - FBW F-16
    . But it has a "real" stick :-)
    . "Reprogrammed"?
    . Does it have (degradation) laws in case of partial failures, 
      like the Airbus?
  - what other components have been "stolen"?
  
* Development History
  - hopeless diamond
  - Senior Trend
  - Have Blue
  - What else?

* Where did the name come from?
  - why F and not B?
  - why 117?
  - when did "Nighthawk" come up? 
    I think that was not an initial name, was it?
 
 
--------- Flight Testing ---------------

* What was the timeline
  - start of dev in the 70s
  - 81 flight testing
  - 83 intro to service
  - 2008 End of Service

* How did you become "first flight" pilot?
  - background/experience
  - There were colleagues in your team, right? 
    Morgenstern, Ferguson

    
* Secrecy during development, test, and early ops
  - initial pictures that made the sweep look less
  - procedures, cover-stories and facilitites 
    . At Area 51, Groom Lake. 
    . did testing happen at night?
    . "satellite evasion"?
    . What did you tell ATC?
  - Did you guys laugh about all the silly rumors?
    F-19? UFOs?

* How did the design balance RCS vs. flight characteristics? 
  - Was it really a compromise?
    . To some degree it was, otherwise they'd just build a sphere.
  -  what other constraints on the design beyond shape?
    . engine inlet grids: enough air? What about engine stalls?
    . flat exhausts: how did this affect engine cooling?


* Stealth Testing
  - The pole 
    . operators thought the system was broken b/c nothing visible
    . ... then a bird landed on it, and it lit up
    . did this actually happen :-) ?
  - stealthiness from all directions? also above?
  - In-flight testing
    . ground to air?
    . air-to-air?
  - how much smaller was the RCS?
    . compare to something F-16 or whatever?
    . doesn't have to be zero to be useful
    
* First flight
  - How much simulation before the first flight
    CFD, Wind Tunnel, Sim
  - single seater: was there a sim for you to familiarize yourself with the a/c?
  - talk about the first flight.
    . take-off w/o ADC, bit lead in nose 
    . yawing problem -> turn on ADC earlier
    . fins too small -> 50% bigger fins
    . tailpipe overheat -> 15 minutes flight
    . canopy open light
  - visibility in cockpit?  

* Flight Characteristics
  - unstable pitch + yaw
  - it's one thing to add artificial stability through a FBW system,
    . but you can't FBW-away turbulence and stuff from a "bad" shape.
  - How did it handle? 
    . speeds
    . AoA range
    . "agility"?
  - Were there unpleasant corners of the envelope?
  - Was it efficient (power to speed or something? probably not very)
  - tuned: feels like a normal airplane
  - Where did the name Wobbly Gobblin come from?
  - And Stinkbug :-) ?
  - How did the other low observability characteristics (grids on intakes,
    flat exhausts) affect the flight characteristics?


* Flight Testing
  - Envelope expansion steps
  - cooperation in testing between company and air force
  - At what point was testing handed over to the AF?
  - What was your involvement after handover?
  - was the test programme more expansive because the a/c was so 
    different from past experience?

* Do we know something about the relative stealthiness of the 
  F-117, B-2, F-22 and F-35? 
  
* Radar reflectors for flying in "normal" airspace?  
  
* Did you ever even try any air-to-air (dog) fighting?
  - never carried a2a weapons, right?


------------- MISSIONS ---------------------------

* Weapons/Sensors
  - Nav: GPS + Inertial
  - FLIR, DLIR, no radar
  - Self-designation vs. 3rd party?
  - Weapons: basically LGBs, right?
 
  
* Operational flying from Tonopah, later Holloman
  - what prompted the move?
  
* Missions
  - typical profile?
  - Air refuelling critical for missions, right?
  - pre-planning vs. "improvisation"?
  - How much was automated, did the pilot do much?
  - More like flying an airliner?
  
* Operational Use
  - (I think) Panama
  - 1990s Gulf War
  - what else is publicly known?
  - did it ever fly during daylight?
  - One was shot down above Bosnia. 
    . What do we know about this?
    . How/why did Stealth "fail"?
 
  
------------- OUTRO ---------------------------

* Rumors of recent use?  

* What did you do after your F-117 time? 
  - F-22 & F-35 first flight by others?
  - but you did fly them, right?

* Flying/testing the F--17 important. But Was it fun? 
  - Is the aircraft fun to fly?
  - Looking back, what airplane did you enjoy most?
