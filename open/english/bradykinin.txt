Medical/biological perspective
-------------------------------------------------------
* What is the question investigated in this project?

* How did you get the idea to look into it?

* What is the starting point 
  - lung fluid
  - 9 patients vs. 40 control
  - is this statistically significant? How do you know?
  
* researchers found an increased expression of enzymes that can trigger the production of 
  bradykinin and a decreased expression of enzymes that would break down bradykinin 
  The team also uncovered that an enzyme that forestalls the bradykinin cascade — the 
  angiotensin-converting enzyme, known as ACE — was less expressed in COVID-19 patients
  
* bradykinin is a known substance
  - what does it do?
  - relationship to ACE/ACE2
    "also the main receptor for Sars-Cov2" -> what does this mean?
  - relationship to blood pressure
  - we do have medicines, right? So that's good news!?
* bradykinin can explain the wide variety of sympotoms 
  - such as muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and decreased cognitive function.  
  - do we know how bradykinin does it?
* theory so far: cytokine storm
  - difference? cytokines regulate immune system.
  - what does bradykinin do?
  
* The lungs of COVID-19 patients are known to have an increased amount of hyaluronic acid
  - where does this come from? Also from brady?
  - Hyaluronic acid can absorb more than 1,000 times its own weight in water to 
    form a hydrogel. 
  - how does this play togetehr with the leakiness of blood vessels due to Brady?  
  - in line with the observation that even when pumping oxy into the lungs it doesn't

* So what overall "working model" of SarsCOV 2 does this suggest? 
  - and which interventions?
  - most of them already FDA-approved pharmaceuticals
  
* Give us a high-level overview over the details of the process (it's not as simple
  as the above suggests) so we can appreciate the complexity.
  HA, RAS, BK, Vitamin D  
  
* “This is one of those rare times where you can really tie everything back to a eureka moment,” 
  said Jacobson, staff scientist in ORNL’s Biosciences Division. “I was looking at data, 
  and I suddenly saw some very distinct patterns happening in the pathways of the 
  renin-angiotensin and bradykinin systems. That led us to do a deep dive of the gene 
  families of the blood pressure regulatory system.” 
  - "looking at the data" suggests some sort of manual, human analysis
  - what exactly did the sim do, which results did it produce, and
    what then was the human "looking" that led to Eureka?

* We seem to know quite a bit about which genes regulate what. 
  - How?
  - I always thought gene therapy was hard because of single gene influencing 
    multiple effects.
  - Might the usggested interventions have unwanted effects as well?  

* All of this is known "manual" analysis of how genes contribute to effects.
  your paper has basically a citation for every step of the overall process. 
  So we know a lot (also: impressive writing!)

Computing perspective
--------------------------------------------------

* So what did the computing do?
  - "the team compared the genes of COVID-19 patients against 
    a control group and analyzed population-scale gene expression data — 17,000 
    samples from uninfected individuals — to see which genes were normally 
    co-expressed, or turned on or off at the same time.  ""
    . what is gene expression
    . what does it lead to?
    . how does this relate to bradykinin?
  - So this is basically a big data analysis of gene expression?
    what were the analysis steps?
  
* Practically speaking, was the computing an enabler or an accelerator?
  - Nine bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples ...
    However, the human reads from these samples
    were discarded 3. Here, we analyze the human RNA-seq data from these BAL
    samples alongside 40 controls. 
  
* Were there free parameters to set in the modeling? 
  - Which? 
  - How did you go about setting those?
  - How do you know the model is "correct"  
  
* Describe Summit  
  - largest supecomp in the US
  - how many petaflops?
  
* What kind of software did you actually run?
  - are these existing codes?
  - what did you have to program/configure?
  - what are the abstractions/models used to perform this analysis?
  - is this only a statistical comparison? or a sophisticated of "mechanics"
    
* What goes into the prep of such a sim?
  - What was already there?  
  - How long did it take to preapre?
 
* Next steps:
  - experiments with drugs?
