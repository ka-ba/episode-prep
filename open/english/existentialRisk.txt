Part 0 - Big Picture
----------------------------------------
* Toby
* The book

Part 1 - What kinds of disasters
-----------------------------------------
* Existential - human race dies out
* Civilization-ending, unrecoverable
  - what does this mean?
  - what is "civilization""?
* 100% dead is waaaay worse than 99%
* but not "just really bad" -> like new dark age
* Why now? 
  - Capability to self-destruct is new
  - what characterises such events? 
    . Why is an exponential gunfight not the problem?
    . A few ppl with very large lever
  - moral prog not keep up wirg tech
  - moral progress not uniform - always assholes. 
    but now asshole with lots of power


Part 2 - Examples
----------------------------------------
* natural vs human made
  - why only human made in book? 
    . isn't a failure to defend against asteroid just as bad 
      as actively causing something?
  - asteroid etc, volcano, star explosion
  - all relatively low risk based on past data
* quantification 
  - why do you give numbers?
  - precision of numbers
  - problem: no prior experience
    . no experience-based probability
    . black swans ... prob is zero based on experience
  - so? How did you do the quantification

* For each of the following: accident vs intentional
  - Nuclear Winter
    . almost happened in Cuba crisis
    . what makes nukes so accident prone? 
      short reaction time
  - Climate Change
    . isn't that a slow process so we can adapt?
    . runaway, moist
  - Biotech
    . half natural, why classified as human made?
    . side Q: current pandemic?
  - AI
    . do we really know it can become "conscious"
    . paper clip machine
    . isnt the facebook ai algos already ai going rogue? or is it humsn profit maximazation

* So what is the conclusion? 
  - Will we die :-) ?
  - which one do you think is most critical?

Part 3 - Why do we care
----------------------------------------
* Does it matter if we die out? 
  - the planet and biodiversity might like it ...
* Reasons 
  - past: prev generartions built this for us to safeguard
  - present: ?
    . "life is suffering
  - future: overall civ potential
    . what exactly is the potential future we might be able to have
    . how do you justify that the value of future, 
      unborn ppl is as valuable as current? 
      not the same as spatial, there the person exists!
    . suffering (cc) diff from non existence
  - cosmic: we might be the only ones
* isn't it just a biological/evo trick that we want to stay around?
* Doesn't it distract from the "now, urgent" stuff?

Part 4 - What do we do?
----------------------------------------
* tradegy of common global scale
  - chaotic, emergence, game theory
* different for each risk
  - prolif control?
  - all behave differently
  - bio?
  - ai?
* why is it so hard for hum to care for long-term stuff?
* Care!
  - moral
  - political
  - societal
* arent the things we have to do to avoid existential 
  death also good to avoid dark ages
* Science and Tech as risk
  - if we don't build it sb else will
  - the role of science vs ???
  - "progress", exponential tech
* Isn't it hopeless? (I am a pessimist :-)) 
  - security-chain analogy
* Can we affort to prepare for everything?
* So what do we do?
