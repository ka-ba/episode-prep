The F-35
===========================================
* A little history
* Its role
  (in many ways the successor to the F-16)
* Current Status
  - introduction to air forces
  - international customers
* Variants
* distinguished features
  . fan, clutch
  . at which weight/reserve can it hover?

Flying the F-35
=========================================
* FCS
* avionics
  - screens
    . touch useful under g? HOTAS
    . transparent cockpit
* helmet, no HUD


  - data fusion and distribution
  - less reliance on AWACS
  - nav w/o GPS? 
    Civilian ILS?

* single seater - how good is the sim?
  (it's a synthetic feel anyway...)

* there's an automatic ejection seat mode?
* Automatic carrier landing?

* compare to F-15  and F-16 in terms of how to fly it
  Even the F-15 and the F-16 were built so to make the flying part as simple 
  as possible so that the pilot could focus on the mission. The F-35 
  takes this even further. How?


* do you feel a diff between the variants in terms of "how it flies"?
  Or is it all hidden by the flight laws?
  (bigger wing, tighter turning can't be hidden, right?)


* "vertical" aspects (we've had a Harrier episode, we can compare :-)
  How much manual?
 
Testing the F-35
=========================================== 
* Workshare/phasing between testing at Lockheed and at the Air Force
  - how is testing organized in the USAF
  - ... what about Navy and Marines, you tested all F-35 variants
* Who designs the test program?
* Based on which standards or regs in the aircraft "certificated"?
* Size of the test org in terms of 
  - aircraf
  - people
  - flights/hours
  - effort

* what are the aspects of the airplane you guys tested
  - ratio between flying time and prep/post time?
  - let's spend some time to really walk through concrete milestones
    and test objectives (to the degree they are not secret)
    eg., how do you move towards STOVL operations
* Were the aircraft specially equipped in some way for the test mission?
  - did you use pre production a/c?
  - strain gauges?
  - a listener who worked at Edwards saw a/c without RAM?
  - did you "kaputt-test" some of them?
  - did you install special instrumentation for certain tests?
    . ADP
    . spin chute
    . special telemetry?
* How does a typical test flight work
  - flight test cards
  - coordination with ground
    how many ppl are involved
    tankers
  - telemetry / realtime monitoring

* what does the aircraft record, how is testing this
  airplane different from older ones b/c of more 
  "intelligence" in the plane
* do you think she's beautiful :-) ?

Other things you did in your career
==========================================
* What did you test during your F-15 testing time?
  It was during a much later stage of the aircraft's service life.
* F-15C and F-15E Instructor Experimental Test Pilot 
  (we've talked to people who went through ETPS, the instructor
  perspective is a great addition!)
* Noble Eagle Missions
