* Overview over the control system
  - it's a big systems & software engineering problem
    for communication, control loops, safety, etc.
  - optical path, enclosure, cooling, instruments
  - But we will focus on the optical path
  
* Overview over the 5-mirror optical path

* Which aspects have to be controlled
  (and which aberrations are there to control)
  - main mirror segments
  - alignment of the path itself
  - adaptive optics
  
* Generally, what is the approach to the control of the optical path?
  - Can the quality be derived from the image, or are special sensors 
    needed?  
  - phasing and diagnostic station

* Is wavefront detection for the AO part of the control, or is this a system 
  that runs "on top of" an aligned telescope?
  Or is this "the end" of the calibration?
  
* The role of the M-ELT in all this
  - what is it
  - limitations compared to "real" system
  - How do you artificially create the distortions?
  
* MAIN PART: Which error comes from which component
  - M1 active control
    . Edge sensors
    . Scalloping on M1  
  - M1 phasing measurement 
    . segment capture
    . stacking
    . coherenceing
  - Blind slew performance characterization
  - M1 scalloping measurement
  - M2 active control functions characterization
  - M3 active control functions characterization
  - M4 response (static and dynamic)
  - M4 phasing
  - M5 response (static and dynamic)
  - Stroke management and offloading schemes (M4, M5, main axis)
  - SCAO + control handover (cascade, sequential)
  - SCAO performance (characterization of M4-5 latency, pupil motion, CCS I/F, ...)
  - Verification of field/pupil stabilization, including low order AO for wind correction
  - Seeing-limited performance plus acquisition sequence (pointing, focus correction)
  - Offsetting/nodding
  - Non-sidereal tracking performance
  - LGS pointing and field/pupil tracking validation
  - LGS performance characterization (jitter, instantaneous PSF, return 
    flux at Nasmyth, elongation, LGS scattering, ...)
