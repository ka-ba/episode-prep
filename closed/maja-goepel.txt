Let us try to separate the state we want to change to from the way we try to get there.
I want to emphasize the second aspect.

göpel: kann man nur warten bis jeder einzelne richtig habdekt? wie kann man das beschleunigen?

Where do we want to go to?
------------------------------------------
* Exploiting the planet less, destroying its climate less
* Sustainable Development - Renewables
* Different metrics for defining "success" for a country.

"This major transformation will require technological advances, new concepts 
 of welfare, diverse social innovations, and an unprecedented level of international 
 cooperation"
 
Yes. So how do we get there?

* Seems to me that in many (not all) cases we know
  (science majority) what we'd need to do. But we
  seem to be unable to make the changes.  


How do we get there
------------------------------------------
* What has to change for this to become a success?
  - institutions, values, laws, ... what else?
    
  - "intrinsically social, full of uncertainties, ups and downs, twists and
    turns and should best be viewed as a dynamic, multidimensional,
    multi-actor and multilevel challenge that cannot be planned and
    predicted in a linear manner"

* Why is change so hard?
  - path dependencies
    Structured Freedom: humanity is limited in thinking by its past
  - feedback loops
  - bias towards keeping things as they are
  - entrenched interests?
  - emergent behavior that has been locked
    in around an "chaotic attractors"

  
* what is transformation research and what are its constituents?
  - innovation management
  - natural sciences
  - and political economy.
  
* why humans collectively create societies that individually they would like to change. 

  - Emergence: small decisions by rationally calculating actors may well lead to
    misallocation effects on the macro scale that produce outcomes which the
    same individuals would not choose 
    
  - research on understanding relations between single elements and
    the dynamics of the whole in order to understand why single elements
    behave the way they do and how this might change. 
    
    As a result, the emphasis when searching for sustainable development solutions 
    is less on improving single technological products or economic incentives, and more
    on understanding the dynamics of wider socio-technical or
    socio-ecological systems (STS or SES) before thinking about which
    interventions could improve sustainability.  
    
    Can we? Aren't they so complex?
    
  - Shouldn't it be a goal to explicitly work on reducing the complexity
    of the societal systems we rely on?
    
    Example: simpler tax laws could make it more likely that people 
    actually invest into sustainable technoligies instead of finding
    even more "lucrative" tax "holes"?
    

  
* Incremental change vs. radical transformation
  - incremental change in prevailing systems will not suffice. 
  - "radical incremental transformation strategies"

* haben d schülerproteste den kick gegen? oder war die zeit reif 
  und sie sind nur symptom

* Can we deterministically engineer/orchestrate change in a particular direction?

* Why is economic change the key?
  - does this relate to "incentives"
  - "it's the ecomomy stupid!"
  - is't it politics that sets the rules for the economy?
    So it is, after all, a political change?
  
* (My) Hypothesis: changes in the past (towards agrarian, industrial) were a "visible" 
  step fwd, whereas the changes required today change now looks like restraint,
  cutback. So they are hard to get buy in.

* Great Mindshift - basically change the collective goals of societies and then "grow"
  the changes bottom up: 
  - do we have to wait for a bottom up realization? Might take (too) long.
  - How do you accelerate this?
  - can we deterministically do that?
    See emergence/complexity above.
  
* System transformations require a build-up 
  - in which not much is visibly happening 
  - before tipping points are reached,
  - after which a lot of change happens in a short period of time. 
  - After this chaotic and contested phase 
  - either a restabilization of the system or its collapse can follow. 
  - Pre-development, Take-off,  Acceleration, Stabilization
  -> What does this tell us for "managing" such processes?

* Polanyi does not describe these changes as a smooth rolling out of a
  blueprint, but as a conflict-ridden process which involved multiple
  changes in technology, social groupings and regulation, all influencing
  each other in a paradoxical pairing of unprecedented material production
  capacity with unprecedented poverty. 
  -> Tainter, Collapse

* The importance of shocks - does it work as a slow change?
  - Tainter's theory of collapse
  - Merkel reaction to Fukushima


Where are we
---------------------------------------
* The world is trying .... 
  - SDGs
  - what else?

* Are we getting there (in time)?
  "System transformations require a build-up " ... where are we?

* how specific is the research to sustainability questions?
