Introduction Edda
(Ep 94, Neutrinos)

Context
===========================================================
- Accelerators: collide beams for particle research
- Accelerate electromagnetically
- currently: around 30 MV/m
- try to improve
- why? 
  . Circular accelerator "resuses" RF cavities 
  . linear does not => efficiency is important otherwise really big
- Also: protons or electrons?
  . protons: garbage can, variety, analysis complexity, "garbage can smasher"
  . leptons: only one particle, precise energy, less background, "scalpel"
- the future after LHC:
  - FCC: 100 km ring, first ee, then hh, like LEP and LHC
  - CLIC: linear collider of leptons ==>> this is where acceleration is crucial
  
New idea for acceleration: Plasma wake field
===========================================================
- ... because it can reach higher delta-V/m
- how does it work in principle?
  . recap: what is plasma
  . why plasma? -ions or electrons?


  . why do you need the plasma?
  . how do you create it?
  . it's for accelerating electron beams
  . drive beam and witness beam
  . why does the field not break down > 100 MeV?
  
- What is AWAKE
  . alternative: drive via laser. Why is protons better?
  . why proton beam?
  . SPS
  . where is it installed?
  . experiment/research goals, 
  . dimensions

- what are the core challenges in practice?
  . need a proton beam => where does it come from?
  . how do you control?
  . pulsing
  . how do you monitor and measure the acceleration of electrons?
  . hows this work on practice?
- Current state?
  . results so far?
  . remainign experimental programme?

- What has to change to make this feasible in a "real" accelerator?

Are there alternative ideas for higher V/m acceleration?
Like the drive beam idea?
