* Introduction Okie

* Flight Characteristics
  - High speed handling
  - Low speed handling
    "kick up spoilers"
  - Wing sweep operation? Manual?
  - Emergencies
    . What was the emergency procedure if the wing mechanism failed? 
    . Ever thought about a one-wing landing like that famous F-15?
    . The flat spin problem?
    . Tom Cruise Stall :-)
  - Engines 
    . Differences between TF30 and F110 very important?
	. Movable inlet ramps?
    . One Engine Flying?
  - Glove vanes 
    . what was their purpose? 
    . Why were they removed? 
    . What difference in performance if any did you notice? 

* Around the Boat
  - Takeoff
  - Approach
  - Landing
    "a handful"
    flaps
    wing front
    direct lift control


* Fighting the Tomcat
  - 6.5g
  - was it really such a great dogfighter? For example
    agains the F-16N?
    "should never win"
  - Was the F-18 or the F-14 the better dog fighter? 
  - Or was its real sweetspot the long range, BVR 
    missile platform?  
  - What was the optimal sweep for air-to-air?
  - Did you adjust the wings in a dogfight? 
    who did?

  - Workshare during combat
 
* Crew Coordination between pilot and RIO
  - do you ever fly backseat?
  - comms
  - flying
  - missions
  - Who selects the weapon, who communicates what?

* Missions  
  - Interception
  - Fleet Defense
  - later: Bombing
  - later: TARPS
  
* Missions & Anecdotes

* Systems
  - Radar 
    . Operation
  - which others are remarkable?
  
 
* Weapons
  - Sidewinder
  - Sparrow
  - Phoenix
  - Air-to-ground?

Life on the carrier  
  
* Differences from A to B (to D)

* Why is the 14 better than the 15 (ducks away :-))



----- NICK ----------------------------------------


* Tomcat’s origins
  - requirements
  - competitors?
  - development timeline
  - Listener Q: If I recall it took around 3 years to go from basic sketch to first flight for 
    the F-14. What was it about engineering back then that made development faster ? 
    I thought computers were supposed to speed us up.. ?
    
* which other countries considered the F-14?
  - it woudl have been a good fit for the UK, Nick Anderson said.
  - Why did the USAF not use the F14 (or more air forces for that matter). 

AWG 9 + Ph

* Introduction into the fleet

* Early Missions

how many?

* Later Missions: 
  - Bombcat
  - TARPS


  
* What prompted the retirement?
  - just too expensive?
  - or did the requirements change to favour the F-18? 
  - There seems no real replacement for the F-14/AIM-54 combination. 
    So could you argue, that the F-14 in its pure Fleet Defender role would
    still be superior to the F-18 ? 
    
    
* Some “myths”
  - Why is this aircraft so much of a cult? Is it really because of Top Gun?
