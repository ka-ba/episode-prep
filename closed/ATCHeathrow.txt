HEATHROW
--------------------------------------------
* Heathrow from an ATC perspective
  - busy!
  - airspace size
  - common airspace with other London airports?
  - "stations" (arrival, departure, delivery, tower, ground/apron ...)
    . quick run through how these interact
    . where are these ppl located?
  - typical operation of the two runway?  
  - hold points


  - coordination with other airspaces / ATC centers


* Aircraft are guided one-by-one, but follow published procedures
  - how exactly does this relationship work:
    . what are pilots expected to do "automatically"
    . what are controllers expected to instruct
  - how much is different every day?
    . example: Air Amb Helis :-)
  - dealing with emergencies? 
  
* Heathrow Tower
  - 360 deg
  - roles and tasks of ppl
  - "ground" also located in tower?  
  - what else is controlled from the tower, except the voice radio
    . runway lighting? 
    . approach systems (ILS)
  
* Major challenges:
  - enhancing the capacity of the airport
  - reducing hold times?
  - keep capacity with declining weather?
  ... while maintaining safety

* What are capacity constraints
  - one a/c on rwy
  - number of rwys
  - separation/vortexes
  - noise 
    . preferred a westerly operation 
    . what else?
  - ?

* What to do
  - continuous descent approaches 
  - introduction of Time Based Separation on approach (currently the only airport in the world using this concept and tool) 
  - Re-categorisation of wake turbulence classifications
  - Flow Control/slot times

  - Airport Collaborate Decision Making

  - Advanced airport safety nets 
  - Automatic routeing and guidance of aircraft on the ground
  - Departure Separation tool
  Each:    
  . idea, insight
  . realization
  . tool support / procedure changes?
  . regulatory impact?
  . requirements on a/c and crew (enablers)
  . successful? capacity increase?


FAIRFORD
---------------------------------------------
* What is RIAT?
* Your involvement - Volunteers.
* Why not regular Fairford tower crew?
* How are the procedures different from a "normal" tower?
* Challenges with an airshow?
  - different a/c (size, speed, capabilities)
  - less planning, more improv?
    eg delay because of broken F16
  - mix between takeoff/landing and use of airspace for displays
  - holding boxes?
* What? No Radar :-) ?
* Departure and Arrivals Days?
* Who is Director Krennic?
