* Quick recap of the overall process
  - detectors and subdetectors
  - data storage
  - data processing

* trigger (online)
  - hardware (level-1 trigger) vs software (event filter)
  - hardware // trigger
    . fast!
      how stored?
    . lots of hardware computations (FPGAs etc)
    . and dedicated detectors
    . "analog processing", eg, optical summing
  - software // event filter
    . recording (see below)
    . simplified reduction

  - terminology: computer sicence (reduction) vs physics (reconstruction)


* Where do we need computing
  - online, i.e. near the detector
    - trigger
    - recording // data aquisition


* Recording // data aquisition (online)
  - transfer from detector comonents to computers
  - lots of fast hard disks
  - event filter
  - transfer to CERN data centre and grid/offline world
  - discuss the storage systems
  
* Reduction // reconstruction
  - what is done?
    . on the sub-detector level
    . identifying objects with particles (probably)
    . taking into account the detector's intricacies
    . from lots of measured hits to particles
    . ... to origin momentum 4-vectors
  - starts to become more computationally intensive
  - where does this happen? At CERN or outside?
  
trick of event filter  
  
  - offline, i.e. in the grid
    - reduction // reconstruction
    - analysis
    - simulation  
  
* Worldwide LHC Computing Grid
  - explain the structure
  - where do you get the connections from? You don't dig.

  - why? isn't just one data centre simpler/more effective?
  - what are the responsibilities of the components
   
* Analysis
  - ... mostly on the machines of institutes?
  - Where does this happen
     


    
* Simulation
  - Monte Carlo
  - Physics Sim // event generation
  - vs. Detector Sim      
    - GEANT 4
    - fast simulation

  - coordination between experiments and computing resources
    . data management
    . workload management
  - monitoring and accoutning

Software!
  parallel
  gpus 

* Archival
  - Data preservation
  - Analysis preservation
