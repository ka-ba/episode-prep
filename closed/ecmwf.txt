* Overview over ECMWF 
  - who is behind it ("European")
  - when was it established


univeristiies?

* What are the "medium" and "long" ranges we are talking about?

* Why is medium forecasting needed

* What "products" do you create? 
  ... and which aspects are forecast? Temp, Hum, Rainfall, ... what else?

* Who are your users?

  

Peter - Model
---------------------------
* Brief recap: how does "regular" weather forecasting work
  - measure
    . satellite pictures of clouds
    . temperature, humidity, wind measured on the ground
    . and some of these params also from satellites
  - discretize volumes
  - calculate forward with (approximated) physical laws

* Components
  - physics 
    . which effects
    . how are they approximated
  - numerics
  - Earth System?
  - what else?

do you know everythign you need to knowÃŸ

chaotic black swans

* What are ensembles?
  50 seems like a low number for the huge param space?

  - convection, cloud formation / coverage
  - waves  
  - stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation 
  - volcanic eruptions

* How do you (retroactively) asses the reliability?
  - Re-forecasting.

* Is SEAS5 categorically different?
  It has to be to some degree, because "regular" forecasts don't work 
  beyond 5 days or so.


* Do you run one model or several?

* Which atmospheric processes are modeled?

* Finer resolution is useful of course ... but what about
  non-linear/chaotic effects. You can't handle those with more
  resolution. As I understand, this is what kills the reliability
  of regular forecasts.
  - eg for top levels in oceans.
  
* How does the medium term forecast relate to short terms?

  "A key requirement for seasonal forecasting is that the initialisation
  of the re-forecasts is consistent with that of the real-time
  forecasts, otherwise the calibration of the forecasts becomes invalid.
  
  



* Do you also adopt ideas from climate models?
  - Right between short-term forecasting and climate modeling?
  - Synergies?

* On the other hand: you are averaging more (I guess), so the problem of
  "where exactly will the Cb develop" and where it will rain, consequently
  is not one you care about.

* Does climate change (ie, really long term not stable) impact
  the way you forecast?


  
* How did the model evolve over time?

* Working towards seamless approach .... means?
  - so it is the same approach/models then ....
  - same model, different parametrization?

* if you could wish, what would improve?

 
 
   - So how good are you :)?
* Grumpy person: you can't even predict tomorrow's weather ..... 


* How long does a forecast run run? Since you target longer range,
  - I guess you can afford if running the algorithms takes longer as well.
  - release once per month. Run a month?
  
* hardware architecture? computers?
  - Cray XC40
  - Hierarchical architecture?
  - processors
  - storage
  - bandwidth
  - OS

  - utilizition ratio of the machine?

  - programming languages and tools?
    . computation modules
    . middleware
how big code basw

* Execution 
  - implemented in which lang?
  - how to paralellize?

what are you working on
ML




Data Assimilation - Tony
--------------------------------------------------
* Which data sources do you use
  - Sea: floats, buoys, ships
  - satellite instruments (which)
  - land: weather stations

* are there standards for the kind of data? 
  I am sure assim is automated.

* "atmospheric state" vs. derivatives/history	

* "assimilation is typically a sequential time-stepping procedure"?
  -> what does this mean?

* how do you decide which data to use? 

* what do you do with the data before it's used?
  - "sanity check" quality?
  - normalize?
  "Improving the handling of satellite signal contamination"

how many sats?
how do you acrually receive dara

* "Developing automated detection, correction and alarm systems to
  monitor the quality of observations from the global network of
  meteorological satellites.

* "Assessing the relative impacts of different types of satellite
  observations and the resulting socio-economic benefit in the wider
  context of future mission design.
