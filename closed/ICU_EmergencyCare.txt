2. Emergency care/intensive care basics

  * What is emergency care? 
    - Everyone who comes to the hospital by ambulance or helicopter? 
    - Happens already in the ambulance or helicopter, right?
    - Things like strokes as well as accidents? 
    - All ages or is there a specific emergency care for children? 
    
  * What is intensive care? Which patients typically go to ICU? 
    - (Accidents/after big surgeries/failure of circulation/bad breathlessness/pneumonia)
  * What is the minimum of automated monitoring a patient will have in intensive care? 
    - Breathing and circulation/heart function? 
    - Also brain function?
    - Which percentage of patients will be on ventilation?
  * How are patients fed in intensive care?
  
  
3. Procedures

  * If a patient already is hospitalised and then gets bad suddenly, 
    will he/she also be treated by emergency care?
  * Is the only goal of emergency care to stabilize the patient and 
    then transfer him/her to another part of the hospital?
  * What does "stabilize" mean? What are life-critical functions of the body?
  
  * What is shock, and how do you deal with it?
  
  * Does it happen often that somebody arrives at the emergency room 
    and "looks" good (e.g. walks in by himself), but if fact is in a very bad condition? 
    Or the other way round?
  
  * What is the standard procedure that you use if somebody arrives 
    at the emergency room to find out how acute the situation is?
    - How complex are the decision procedures? I remember studies that suggested
      that using very few relatively high level rules are better than something
      more elaborate; see http://voelter.de/temp/icu.png
      
      
3. Intubation/Ventilation

  * Why? What is wrong in the lung?
  * Difference between "supplying oxygen" and actual ventilation
  * What kinds of ventilation are done?
  * Is mechanical ventilation done with normal air? 
    With a higher portion of oxygen?
  * When is mechanical ventilation (with pressure) necessary? 
    - When the muscles are not strong enough to move compress the lungs?
    - what are the risks of high pressure?
  * Ventilation only makes sense if the lungs can still transfer the oxygen into the 
    blood. If this is not possible any more, the blood must be enriched with oxygen 
    outside the body, right?
  * How can the patient come out of ventilation again? 
    - Do the lungs start to works by themselves automically again?
    . Don't the lungs get "lazy"?
  * Maybe more in general, how ventilators compare to other breathing apparatus. For 
    example oxygen concentrators, or the equipment you get in aircraft.
  * What is the long-term impact of being ventilated? 
    What damage is done to the lungs?
  * What is the difference between a ventilator and a bpap / cpap?


4. Infectious diseases in emergency and intensive care

  * If somebody comes into emergency room what will make 
    the doctors alert they could have an infectous disease?
  * Which precautions are taken? 
    - Are there any standard tests that are done on everybody 
      to prevent that infections introduced in the hospital?
  * How does COVID-19 change the ECU and ICO processes?
  
    
5. Additional questions by listeners

  * As I understand, emergency care relies heavily on blood donors - 
    - what is the typical way from donor to care
    - and what else can be donated this way and what for?
    
  * what about projects like https://corovent.com? is having a cheap purpose built 
    ventilator the key to our current situation or are cases where covid gets to a 
    ventilator stage already highly fatal, so the impact isn't that high?
  * Is it possible to build DIY-ventilators with stuff like Arduino or is it just 
    a dangerous nerd-dream ignoring the complexity involved
