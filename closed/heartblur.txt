* Heatblur: team and structure
* General: what are the sources for building such a sim:
  - literature?
  - SMEs?
* Flight model
  - which aspects are simulated?
  - how did you validate?
  - how do the algorithms look:
    . actual CFD calculations?
    . lookup-tables that contain the "result" of CFD sims?
    . mixture?
* Avionics
  - how detailed?
  - validation?
  - I assume this is "nachprogrammiert" and does not sim the microprocessor in the a/c
  - which other systems? 
    "AWG9 we simulate the computer ..." what does this mean?
  - INS + Navigation
    accelerometer, gyrodrift, earth magnetiv variation, auch
    subsystems are realistic, eg loss of INS during cat shot 
* Visualization
  - sources for the visuals?
  - rendering algos?
  - raytracing? 
  ... or do you just supply a model to DCS and it runs the visualization?
* What are the integration points/APIs wrt to DCS?
