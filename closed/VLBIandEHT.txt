Radio Interferometry
---------------------------------------
* Recap: Radio frequencies
* Recap: what is interferometry, and why do astronomers do it
* Difference between optical and radio interferometry
  - Use VLA (analog) and ALMA (digital) as examples?
* Key component: the correlator


VLBI
---------------------------------------
* VLBI is always an "offline" technique 
  - in the sense that the resulting image is produced later?
  - is this the only difference in approach compared to a "local" radio
    interferometer such as ALMA?

* Use the multiple telescopes -> VLB
  "act as a phased array, a virtual telescope which can be pointed electronically, 
   with an effective aperture which is the diameter of the entire planet"

* How do you align time?
  - shared time sources is hard. GPS?
  - use of local atomic clocks?
  - or use a "spike" signal that can be used to synchronise "on sky"?
  - Can this be done computationally, in postprocessing?
  
* How it works
  - high-rate sampling
  - "replay" at central site with aligned time
    . BUT: there is some intended time difference due to different positions,
      this is the point of interferometry. How do you deal with this?
    . and there might be atomspheric delays as well.
  - the closure phase imaging technique 

* Applications
  - in astronomy
  - briefly: in geodesy

* what other challenges are there?
  - location, perspective
  - telescope sizes or technologies?
  

EHT
-----------------------------------
* Who is behind it? Lots :-)

History

* A global VLBI array of 
  - eight stations over six geographical locations.  
  - Baseline lengths eanged from 160 m to 10,700 km toward M87
  - array with a theoretical diffraction-limit resolution of ∼25 μas  


did you build new corr?



* It's basically a VLBI-collaboration. What's special?
  freq?
  - deployment of submillimeter dual polarisation receivers
  - increased noise in radio receiver electronics
  - increased phase fluctuations caused by atmospheric turbulence
  - decreased efficiency and size of adio telescopes in the millimeter and submillimeter observing bands.
  - highly stable frequency standards to enable very-long-baseline interferometry at 230–450 GHz,
  - higher-bandwidth VLBI backends and recorders
  - as well as commissioning of new submillimeter VLBI sites


"VLBI Equipment"  
  

  
* Why 1.33 mm? 
* Why do we need so many telescopes (as opposed to few that are far apart)?

* Who decides which baseline (pair) does a measurement when?

* What kind of theory/modeling work was necessary in advance to make
  the observation feasible?
  polarization fix sw
* How did EHT profit/learn from ealier VLBI experiments?
  - Were there pathfinders before the big investment?




Image Reconstruction
---------------------------------------------
Level of detail depends on whether this will be part
of the interview with Heino, or whether I can convince
Katie to talk about this aspect.
---------------------------------------------
* What kind of data is "delivered" by the telescopes?

* "Image reconstruction is an ill-posed inverse problem"   
  - What does this mean?
  - sparsity of the uv-sampling
* Processing steps: like with any VLBI, as discussed earlier?
* The algorithms that were ultimately used were 
  - a regularized maximum likelihood algorithm 
  - and the CLEAN algorithm
* Could we have taken the image if we hadn't know how it would look before?
* How do you know you can "trust" the image with all the free parameters?
  multiple independent calibration and imaging techniques
  

* Some example VLBI arrays
  - EVN
  - VLBA

   
The "famous" observation
----------------------------------------
* What exactly does the picture show?
  - predicted black hole “shadow”, a feature caused by severe 
    light bending at the black hole boundary
* It's not really a (visual) picture ...
* Why this target?
* Is it rotating? Are "snapshots" required?
* How long was the exposure? How many?
* "With the atmospheric conditions during our observations the
   coherent integration time was typically 10s. Use of hydrogen 
   maser frequency standards at all EHT sites ensures coherence 
   across the array over this
   timescale. After observations, recordings are staged at a central
   location, aligned in time, and signals from each telescope-pair
   are cross-correlated."a

   
  
Wrap Up
-----------------------------  
* What was observed
  - M87
  - what is the scientific relevance? We knew about the EH before.
    . Relativity.
* What kind of new astronomy does this allow?
