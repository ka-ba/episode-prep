* Who are you and what do you do?

* How did you get to fly the P-3?
  
Flying the P-3
-------------------------------
* The Airplane
  - Electra Roots
  - describe:  
    . aerodynamics
    . engines
    . handling envelope and characteristics
    hydraulic
  - quirks?  
  - what is special about the AP-3C compared to the P-3C?

* Reliability

* Sensors
  - MAD
  - Radar
  - FLIR
  - Acoustics - this is the "black art" of submarine hunting
  
* "Sensors" for flying?
  . Night?
  . Weather Limits?

* Weapons (not too detailed - classified)
  - Kinetic!
  - Mines - we don't carry mines in the RAAF, so I can mention it, but I won't have detail
  - Torpedos
  - Anti-ship missiles
  
* Missions
  - how long? extra crew?
    . fatigue?

  - maneuver
  - typical day ("breakfast with the crew")

  - team 
  - Collaboration cockpit crew / mission crew?
    . Crew composition and dynamics

* What are some of the flying challenges?
  - Flying low over the sea?
    . "blueout"?
    . "precise hand flying without the aid of the autopilot"
    . weather limits
  - Switching off engines ...
  
* Talk a bit about your flying all around the world
  - search and rescue missions in the Southern Ocean
    . Longest/most memorable day? 
    . link to story: http://australianaviation.com.au/2018/11/over-watch-when-a-raaf-orion-crew-answered-the-sar-call
  - anti-piracy missions off the coast of Somalia
  - chasing submarines off the coast of Southern California
  - Taking-off in the eye of a cyclone (to evacuate the aircraft - it's a great story)
  - The best thing about flying the P3 (it's the crew!)
  
  - eventual replacement?
  P8 
 
  
Test Pilot School
-------------------------------
* How did you end up there?
  - Science Nerd?
  - "just being in Edwards" ... I know :-)

* Syllabus
  - theory; which subjects?
  - flying
  
* Which airplanes? 23
  - MiG 15
    . interesting flying characteristics? 
    . knowing how to read cyrillic when hopping into a Russian cockpit!

  - T-38
  - F-16
  - C-12

  - ASK-21 :-)
  - F-15
    . "whats wrong with your face"
* Compare f-15 and f-16 
  (Newbie perspective)
    
  - An-2 
    . salt lake hopping
  - Extra 300
    . you don't do much negative g in military jets, right? 
  - HU-16
    . including the time we crashed one a little bit? :-)

* Why fly so many airplanes? 

* Are all of these owned by TPS? Or lend to it?


* The F-16 VISTA
  - how are the flight control systems different (compare to F-16 episode)
  - rear cockpit is the "management" cockpit
  - fly like ... (what's interesting?)
    . C-17
    . Century Series
    . Shuttle
  - what is the point of using it in the TPS?

* Spinning
  - the Magister - spin like any other airplane?
  - What do you have to do to spin the F-16?  I'll talk about "falling with style"
  - Did you spin the ASK-21?

* Relationship of flight test and science?
  
* What did you do as a test pilot after TPS?
  - tufting a P-3? I can talk at length about this program, including tufting and 
    flying with Hornet chase taking video footage of the tufting while I held the P3 
    in a regime that induced a global airframe vibration :-)


A Female Pilot in the Air Force
-------------------------------
* Talk a bit about your experiences

* Do flight suits fit (saw your tweet :-))

* Female Role model in av/stem? Still necessary?

* What will you do/fly when the last AP-3C is retired?
